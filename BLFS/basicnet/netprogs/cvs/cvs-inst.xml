<title>安装 <application><acronym>CVS</acronym></application></title>

<!--
<para><filename>cvs-&cvs-version;-zlib.patch</filename> patch is
used to compile <application><acronym>CVS</acronym></application>
dynamically against <application>zlib</application> instead of using the version
included with the <application><acronym>CVS</acronym></application>
source. This has the advantage that if (or when) there is a security
vulnerability found in <application>zlib</application>, you don't need to wait for a
new version of <application><acronym>CVS</acronym></application> to
appear as once you have upgraded <application>zlib</application>, the problem
will be fixed.</para>

<para>If you are going to use the patch mentioned above, first apply it:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>patch -Np1 -i ../cvs-&cvs-version;-zlib.patch</command></userinput></screen>
-->

<para>安装<application><acronym>cvs</acronym></application> 可以使用下面命令:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</command></userinput></screen>
